on both the news.php for the previews and on the article.php for displaying the full article
change imagecopyresized so it doesnt stretch the image

either on buchen.php or a seperate data handler file

## CSS / DESIGN

Change the look of most forms (especially the ones using login-register css classes)
Review if layout should be changed for those forms

## Database

Implement simple database setup to allow for better storage handling.
