## NEWS

Set the article previews to link to their respective article using GET on the news.php
implement an article loader based on the GET array
if the get array is empty, no specific article is loaded and the "default" news page is displayed
(/news.php) - default page with the previews | (/news.php?article=articleId) - article page with full data

## BOOKING

Add checkboxes for extras like parking
develop the javascript further for efficient display of the selected extras
make the prices of the extras be conditionally displayed, do not show if not selected

lines could be added onto the .innerText instead of setting it in one go
this would easily allow for conditionally displaying the needed extras in the text and adding the resulting costs to the price one by one.
if(extra1) -> add new line to .innerText with the resulting cost of the extra -> add resulting price to a sum value
repeat for every extra

## CSS / DESIGN

Change the look of most forms (especially the ones using login-register css classes)
Review if layout should be changed for those forms
