## NEWS / ARTICLE

Work on styling and layout
on both the news.php for the previews and on the article.php for displaying the full article
change imagecopyresized so it doesnt stretch the image

## BOOKING

Work on the php handling of the booking data,
either on buchen.php or a seperate data handler file

## CSS / DESIGN

Change the look of most forms (especially the ones using login-register css classes)
Review if layout should be changed for those forms

## Database

Implement simple database setup to allow for better storage handling.

## Page Structure / Technology

Work on a module based page
Implement a on-page router. This probably needs config to be changed in xampp/apache, as we always want to route to index.php

Find a way to efficiently route pages together with footers like it is possible in react
This would allow for setting multiple routes inside of a structure that renders headers and footers aswell as outside of that
route.
This would ease work on new pages and eliminates the use of including main css styles aswell as the footer and header on
every page.
