## Page Structure / Technology

Work on a module based page
Implement a on-page router. This probably needs config to be changed in xampp/apache, as we always want to route to index.php

Find a way to efficiently route pages together with footers like it is possible in react
This would allow for setting multiple routes inside of a structure that renders headers and footers aswell as outside of that
route.
This would ease work on new pages and eliminates the use of including main css styles aswell as the footer and header on
every page.

IDEA: Currently the use_header, use_nav etc. are only set at the end when no path is found anymore.
We could change this behavior so the variables are set everytime it finds them set in every path
With this we could set everything on true in '/', so all sub-paths have every component enabled,
without writing it on every page, but a single page can still overwrite this by setting different
booleans.

Example:
'/' route:
subpath1,
subpath2,
subpath3 = [
nav = false
],
header = true,
nav = true,
footer = true

This would set everything on true expect for the nav in subpath3
(The route '/' would would cause the router to set the variables on true and in case that the route/page accesed is subpath3, the router will set the nav variable to false)
